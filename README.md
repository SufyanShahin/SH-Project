This project began as a technical exercise as part of the application process to a data scientist position at Syneos Health.
Parts of the code for this project are in thanks to Shreye Saxena for his work with getting tracks to study through Spotipy.

Additional help came from Saptashwa Bhattacharyya's work and blog on Toward's Data Science with spatial clustering.
